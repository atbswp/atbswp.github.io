### What should be the output of each snippet ?
```python
>>> a = [[0]*2]*3
>>> for i in range(2):
...     m[0][i]=1
>>> print a
```

```python
>>> float('infinity')
>>> float('NaN')
>>> float('string')
```

```python
>>> a={}
>>> a[1.0]= 'laksh'
>>> a[1]= 'arora'
>>> a[1.0]
```

```python
>>> a = -4
>>> b = -4
>>> a is b
# What should be the output ? True or False ?
>>> a = -10
>>> b = -10
>>> a is b
# What should be the output ? True or False ?
```

```python
>>> for i in range(10): print "*",
# The above line of code results in this :
>>> * * * * * * * * * *
# So try to print this :
>>> **********

# NOTE The first line of output of stars have spaces between each other, 
now we want to print without any spaces. "THINK!"
```
